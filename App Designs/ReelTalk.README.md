🎬 ReelTalk — Social Movie App Concept

ReelTalk is a UI/UX design concept for a modern social movie app that lets users chat, discover, and share real-time reactions while watching films or series.
It merges the excitement of streaming with the fun of social interaction — turning every movie night into a shared experience.

🧩 What’s Inside
	•	Onboarding flow introducing users to the app’s core features
	•	Clean, responsive layout designed for easy navigation
	•	Interactive prototype showing transitions and micro-animations
	•	Vibrant, cinematic design language that reflects connection and emotion

  🎨 Design Process

The design began with low- and mid-fidelity wireframes, followed by high-fidelity visuals and animation to create a lively, human-centered experience.
This project showcases my skills in UI storytelling, interaction design, and prototyping for user engagement.

🛠️ Tools Used
	•	Figma (UI, Prototyping, Animation)
	• Freeform (Wireframe)
